Notes for DnD char sheet

Level Up functionality
Hit Points editor
Magic item box - perhaps on the other side of the box
scrolling of the whole thing
other sode of the char sheet
Dice UI
weapons Database
Tkinter colour scheme
Spells by class and level
expandable window
add a section for notes about the character ( ie the abilities and stuff)
add class descriptions to the inputting of class data page- in file class_descriptions.json


maybe condense the code within init_list so that all of the lists are within one list

maybe best to make a class called character which holds all of the data about the character which can then be changed,
Which would aviod the need for a file write. but then the file write is also a good idea for the saving part of the program.
